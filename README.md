## Main direction of design
**Pick a theme, and keep it consistent throughout the webpages**
* Choose a theme: My theme is light, informal, and simple.  
* Color: pick 2 or 3 colrs that matchs, and keep it consistent. I used yellow( background color), red (matchs with gmail icon), and navy

## Problems I encountered
The biggest problem I have is the design. I have changed the design for at least 5 times and they all look ugly to me. Lesson here: **find a professional designer to help me with the portfolio design later in this course.**

## Thigs I would like to add 
My pages are pretty simple. So it would be nice if some animations are added to keep it interesting. 

## My thoughts after the homework
For the first page, I was trying to make the layout piece by piece all by myslef, using css, and it took me at least 3 days to finish the design. All those centering, changing margin, alinging were driving me crazy. 

From the second page, I started to use bootstrap classes, still got confused by h-75,h-100,and w-50,w-100 (it doesn't response sometimes and I have no clue why!!!!), but effecieny is much higher and my css code looks neater. 
And for the third page, I checked online bootstrap template, it is AMAZING. 

**Bootstrap rules. It worth some time to read through all the documents and get familer with the classes.**
