# homework2: Responsive Portfolio

## content
* **html**
   * index.html (homepage)
   * portfolio.html
   * contact me.html
* **css**
   * style-home.css
   * style-portfolio.css
   * style-contact.css
* pics 


## Main direction of design
1. Pick a theme, and keep it consistent throughout the webpages
* choose a theme: My theme is light, colorful,informal, and simple.  
* Color: pick 2 or 3 colrs that matchs, and keep it consistent. I used yellow( background color), red (matchs with gmail icon), and navy
![color theme](master/pics/color.jpg)
* pick an icon or symbol (like company logo). I used code symbol </>,  < >

2. My homepage will be simple, and has less info, mainly used as a preface of my website. More infos will be provided in portfolio page. But still, try to keep the color light and cheerful, whole layout simple and less words. 

3. contact me page will be similar to the homepage. 


## problems I encountered
The biggest problem I have is the design. I have changed the design for at least 5 times and they all look ugly to me. Lesson here: find a professional designer to help me with the portfolio design later in this course. 

## Thigs I would like to add 
My pages are pretty simple. So it would be nice if some animations are added to keep it interesting.
